# GPG key

Gibhub has introduced a cool new function that allows creators to 'sign' their commits. This will show up as a green 'verified' on github.

Simply put, GPG, is an encrpytion software program.

There are a few simple steps to follow in order to get this up and running.

### 1. [Generate a new GPG key](https://github.com/pn101/instructio4/blob/master/GPG%20key/generategpg.md)
